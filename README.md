## Installation

### Manual
- Simply add the `SKRecordView` folder to your project.
- Create a SKRecordView object give it it's frame.
- Set it's properties (Icon, animating images, animation duration and recordingLabelText).
- Set the current viewContoller as the SKRecordViewDelegate.
- Call the setupRecordingView function
- Add the SKRecordView object to your view.
- Add constrains for it's placing in your view.
- Now you are up and running with using the SKRecordView.


### code

```swift
  		    let recordingView = SKRecordView(frame: CGRectMake(0, UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds.height-100 , UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds.width , 100))
        recordingView.delegate = self
        recordingView.recordingImages = [UIImage(named: "rec-1.png")!,UIImage(named: "rec-2.png")!,UIImage(named: "rec-3.png")!,UIImage(named: "rec-4.png")!,UIImage(named: "rec-5.png")!,UIImage(named: "rec-6.png")!]
        recordingView.normalImage = UIImage(named: "mic.png")!
        
        view.addSubview(recordingView)
        
        let vConsts = NSLayoutConstraint(item:self.recordingView , attribute: .Bottom, relatedBy: .Equal, toItem: self.view, attribute: .Bottom, multiplier: 1.0, constant: 0)
        
        let hConsts = NSLayoutConstraint(item: self.recordingView, attribute: .Trailing, relatedBy: .Equal, toItem: self.view, attribute: .Trailing, multiplier: 1.0, constant: -10)
        
        view.addConstraints([hConsts])
        view.addConstraints([vConsts])
        recordingView.setupRecordingView()

```

you can get the recorded File path in the SKRecordView object by calling :
- getFileURL()
 which will return an NSURL object with the recorded file url
